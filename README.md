## Fiber Crafts Project Journal - CMSC389N Semester Project

### Instructions to run:

Run npm install in the FiberCraftsProjectJournal directory, as well as in both the frontend and backend directories, then run npm start

###### Note: There is no commit history for this project because I had to copy it from the original repository, since the original repository contains code for class exercises that will be reused in later semesters and so the code cannot be put in a public repository.
